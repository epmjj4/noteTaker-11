In the db folder, inside the log.js file, I setup the fs, uuid, and util drivers. I also created the class log with read, write, getNotes, addNotes, and deleteNote methods. Under the routes folder, I created the apiRoutes and htmlRoutes js files so I can route the data and render it to the html page. In the server js file I installed the express module as well as the routes for the apiRoutes and htmlRoutes.
