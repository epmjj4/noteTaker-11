I created the express module as well as the apirRoutes and htmlRoutes in the server.js file. In the apiRoutes folder I setup the router to use express as well as the get, post, delete functions. In the log.js file, I set up the drivers for the fs and util. I also created the class log function with read/write/getnotes/addnotes/delete functions.
